I am currently an academic tutor (teaching assistant in the US) in the [School of Economics](https://economics.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I received my Bachelor of Computer Science in 2008 from the University of Sao Paulo and expect to obtain my Bachelor of Economics in 2023 from the University of Queensland.
