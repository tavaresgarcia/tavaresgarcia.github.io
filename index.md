I am currently a teaching assistant in the [School of Economics](https://economics.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) (UQ). I received my Bachelor of Economics in 2023 from UQ and my Bachelor of Computer Science in 2008 from the University of Sao Paulo (USP). In 2024, I will be studying the School of Economics' honours program in the field of econometrics at UQ.
