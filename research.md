*The Impact of Monetary Policy on Income Inequality: Does Inflation Targeting Matter?* (with [Jamie Cross](https://jamiecross.com.au/){:target="_blank"})

Does inflation targeting affect the nexus between monetary policy and income inequality? We address this question by estimating country-specific structural vector autoregression models across the G7 economies. In line with existing studies, we find that contractionary monetary policy shocks increase income inequality when using a long period of data from 1974-2019. However, we also find that controlling for the adoption of inflation targeting reduces the size of this effect within Japan and the UK, and in Canada and the US, it disappears altogether. These results suggest that country-specific inflation targeting may mitigate the inequality-inducing consequences of unanticipated monetary contractions. In contrast, mixed evidence is found for those countries in the Eurozone: France, Germany, and Italy.
