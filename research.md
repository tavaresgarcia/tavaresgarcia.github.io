*The Impact of Monetary Policy on Income Inequality: Does Inflation Targeting Matter?* (with [Jamie Cross](https://jamiecross.com.au/){:target="_blank"})

Does inflation targeting affect the nexus between monetary policy on income inequality? We address this question by estimating country-specific structural vector autoregression models across the G7 economies. In line with existing studies, we find that contractionary monetary policy shocks tend to increase disposable income inequality. However, we also find that this effect has decreased in countries that have adopted inflation targeting, and in some cases, it has disappeared altogether. This suggests that inflation targeting may mitigate some of the inequality-inducing consequences of monetary contractions.
