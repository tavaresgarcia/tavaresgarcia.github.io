I am currently a teaching assistant in the [School of Economics](https://economics.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) (UQ). I received my Bachelor of Economics in 2023 from UQ and my Bachelor of Computer Science in 2008 from the University of Sao Paulo (USP). In 2024, I will be studying the School of Economics' [honours program](https://study.uq.edu.au/study-options/programs/bachelor-economics-honours-2132) in the field of Econometrics at UQ.
